# DevStream: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development in the Browser

DevStream is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browserâ€”no local setup required. If you're here to build you can get started at [devstream.dev](https://devstream.dev).

## What Makes DevStream Different

Claude, v0, etc are incredible- but you can't install packages, run backends or edit code. That's where DevStream stands out:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: DevStream integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by **StackBlitz's WebContainers**. This allows you to:

  - Install npm packages
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Edit code in real-time
  - Preview your app live
  - Deploy to production

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, DevStream gives AI models **complete control** over the entire environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire development workflow.

Whether you're an experienced developer, a PM or designer, DevStream allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

## Getting Started

Here are some tips to get the most out of DevStream:

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your prompts are, the better results you'll get. Instead of "build me a todo app", try "build me a todo app with React that persists data to localStorage and has a clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS".

2. **Start Small**: Begin with a simple feature or component, then gradually build up complexity. This helps the AI understand your requirements better and produces more accurate results.

3. **Iterate**: Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use follow-up prompts to refine and improve the code. The AI remembers the context of your conversation.

## Pricing

DevStream is free to get started. If you need more AI tokens or want private projects, you can purchase a paid subscription in your [DevStream](https://devstream.dev) settings, in the lower-left hand corner of the application.
